README: Sokoban Terminal Game

Sokoban, which means "warehouse keeper" in Japanese, is a classic transport puzzle game where the player's objective is to push boxes or crates onto designated storage locations within a warehouse. This implementation of Sokoban is designed to run in terminal mode using the ncurses library.
Overview

    Objective: Push all boxes onto storage locations to win the game.
    Author: Nicolas Dumetz

Rules

    The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is either a floor or a wall.
    Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.
    The player (represented by 'P') can move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes).
    The player can push boxes ('X') by moving into them, but boxes cannot be pulled.
    Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls.
    The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations.

Usage

bash

$ ./my_sokoban map

Arguments

    map: File representing the warehouse map, containing:
        # for walls,
        P for the player,
        X for boxes,
        O for storage locations.
